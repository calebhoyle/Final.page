            <p>After I finished my brainstorming process and I was happy with my design I was 
            onto the first print.<br> I learned more about Onshape and how to use it, I then designed <br>
            my idea on the software. After I tried to use the 3d printers in class and discovered that my laptop could not run <br>
            the splicing software<br> required for the in class printers. After discovering this I emailed the file containing my <br>
            design to my groupmate Max, who agreed to print my project on his 3d printer at home. <br> 
            When Max brought my print into class it had some flaws. The extrusions of the wings went through the
             hole in the middle making it impossible to spin on the shaft. The second flaw was that I forgot to <br>
             include a hole for the set screw that holds the propeller to the shaft.
