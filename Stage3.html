        <p>In this stage of the project I had to figure out how to fix those flaws in the previous stage. <br>
        Firsly I made sure that the wings did not extrude through the center hole by adding a helix that <br>
        connected to the exterior of the hole instead of the center. After this I added a hole towards the top <br>
        of the propellor for the set screw. In the splicer I also made the wings wider and extend to <br>
    the top instead of 3/4 of the way, this was for more air resistance.  </p>
