        <h2>2nd Print</h2>
        <p>After Redesigning and correcting those flaws I put the file into a splicer and printed the new and<br>
        improved design. Because my laptop could not run the splicing software and I couldn't wait for <br>
    the next week for Max to bring my next product into class, I found the 3d printers in the <br>
    lab downstairs that ran on the computers with the splicing software already downloaded. Once my new file <br>
was loaded into the software, I put it into the printer using an SD card and began my print. <br>
My first try was not successful. The print fell off-balance while in progress and the material webbed up creating <br>
    a mess that did not resemble my design. After this I added what is called a raft during the splicing <br>
    process. A raft is a base that the print can sit on and creates a balanced platform. After adding things
    the next print was successful and came out how I wanted it to.
